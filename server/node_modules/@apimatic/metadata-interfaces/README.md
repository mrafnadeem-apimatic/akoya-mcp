# Metadata Interfaces

Defines interfaces and types for the metadata subpackage in the SDK. This allows the SDK's metadata to be consumed by any application e.g. for creating a CLI or MCP Server.

For a reference application, see the [`mcp-core`](../mcp-core/) package.

This package includes:
- Branded type for the SDK client
- Interface for endpoint metadata
- Interface for request schema
- Interface for the Endpoints object which will contain all endpoint metadata
